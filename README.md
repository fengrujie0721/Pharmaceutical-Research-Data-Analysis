Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In one study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. Generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study to get a top-level summary of the study results.

Final tumor volume of mice treated with 4 drugs: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.

Average tumor volume and weight of mice treated with Capomulin.


Three observations:
    1.Male mouse number and female mouse number are almost the same.
    2.Capomulin and Ramicane have similar effects on tumor in mice in terms of final tumor volume.
    3.For mice treated with Capomulin, the average tumor volume is related to mouse weight. 
      The higher the mouse weight, the larger the average tumor volume.
